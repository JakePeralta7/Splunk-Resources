# Machine Learning Toolkit

The Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit helps you apply a variety of machine-learning techniques and methods, such as classification (predicting a yay or nay), regression, anomaly detection, and outlier detection against your data. The different showcases in this app illustrate how to apply these methods to a sample of datasets, which are included in the app for you to use as a starting point for building your own analysis.
